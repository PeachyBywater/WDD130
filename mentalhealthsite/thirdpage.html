            <h2>Welcome to the WAM Forums</h2>
            <p> <br>Making the decision to look deeper into the status of your mental health can be intimidating.
                    We understand, we've been there! Join our moderated online forums and find your community. 
                    This is a safe place where you can find and talk to other people who might be taking the same 
                    medication as you are, those with similar diagnoses, individuals going through loss, etc.<br> 

                    <br>Note that while you may be able to access forums and discussions, you will need to be registered 
                    to be able to contribute and post.<br>

                    <br>Our community guidelines are simple! Failure to follow these guidelines will get you kicked out and blocked. 
                    Please keep in mind that we are trying to create a space where everyone who is struggling and/or willing 
                    to help those who are, will be comfortable and feel heard.<br>
                    
                    <br>Guidelines:<br>
                    <br>No to any forms of bullying, racism or harassment. We do not give second chances with these incidents, 
                    so we ask you to be mindful of your interaction with others. If you don't think you can't say it to your 
                    mom's face, you shouldn't be saying it to other people either!<br>

                    <br>No spam. Please, we have enough baggage in our lives. We don't need that kind of negativity around here.<br>
                    
                    <br>Be helpful and relevant. We all want to be heard. Treat others with respect the way you would want to be 
                    treated and stay on topic. If you have nothing nice to say or it doesn't add to the conversation, doodle 
                    that stuff down in your journal instead.<br>
