      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>These days, information about topics such as mental health can be found all over the world wide web. 
        But how do you go through the tons of data that you can gather online? Which ones are reliable and trustworthy? 
        This website will be an online community where one can look for curated resources about mental health and other related issues. 
        Not to be mistaken as medical advice, only a social network where I can share what I have experienced and learned throughout 
        my mental health journey over the years.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is not intended to be a place for people to refer to in place of a proper medical assessment. 
        This is only a resource for those who are in the beginning stages of taking a closer look at their mental health. 
        The site can be considered a guide for many of us who are overwhelmed with the staggering amount of information 
        available on the world wide web. The target audience are mostly females, as young as teenagers to grandmothers. 
        They are tech-savvy, connected to people with social media, listen to podcasts and are open to new ideas about 
        the concept of mental health.</p>  <!-- change this -->
