      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>These days, information about topics such as mental health can be found all over the world wide web. 
        But how do you go through the tons of data that you can gather online? Which ones are reliable and trustworthy? 
        This website will be an online community where one can look for curated resources about mental health and other related issues. 
        Not to be mistaken as medical advice, only a social network where I can share what I have experienced and learned throughout 
        my mental health journey over the years.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is not intended to be a place for people to refer to in place of a proper medical assessment. 
        This is only a resource for those who are in the beginning stages of taking a closer look at their mental health. 
        The site can be considered a guide for many of us who are overwhelmed with the staggering amount of information 
        available on the world wide web. The target audience are mostly females, as young as teenagers to grandmothers. 
        They are tech-savvy, connected to people with social media, listen to podcasts and are open to new ideas about 
        the concept of mental health.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello and welcome to WAM! My name is Peachy Bywater and I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about 5 years ago. 
        This website serves as an online journal of my mental wellness journey, and I'm so glad you're here! When I received my 
        formal diagnosis, I was devastated and relieved at the same time. My anxiety was manifesting as anger, and it was affecting 
        my relationships with my family and friends. I was glad to finally figure out what was going on with me, but I was scared 
        of how that might affect everything else in my life.

        It took two years of therapy, being on medication and the constant support of my family and friends to be where I am at 
        right now. And where I am at in my life is not perfect, but being aware of the status of my mental healtH has made a huge 
        difference in my life. Here you can find information about my favorite podcasts that talk about mental health issues, book 
        recommendations that has made a difference, and an opportunity to find people on the same boat (or just want to help them 
        paddle along) as you are.

        Welcome to the WAM Forums
      </p>
      <p>Making the decision to look deeper into the status of your mental health can be intimidating.
        We understand, we've been there! Join our moderated online forums and find your community. 
        This is a safe place where you can find and talk to other people who might be taking the same 
        medication as you are, those with similar diagnoses, individuals going through loss, etc.

        Note that while you may be able to access forums and discussions, you will need to be registered 
        to be able to contribute and post.

        Our community guidelines are simple! Failure to follow these guidelines will get you kicked out and blocked. 
        Please keep in mind that we are trying to create a space where everyone who is struggling and/or willing 
        to help those who are, will be comfortable and feel heard.
      </p>
      <p>Guidelines:</p>
      <p>No to any forms of bullying, racism or harassment. We do not give second chances with these incidents, 
      so we ask you to be mindful of your interaction with others. If you don't think you can't say it to your 
      mom's face, you shouldn't be saying it to other people either!</p>

      <p>No spam. Please, we have enough baggage in our lives. We don't need that kind of negativity around here.</p>
      
      <p>Be helpful and relevant. We all want to be heard. Treat others with respect the way you would want to be 
      treated and stay on topic. If you have nothing nice to say or it doesn't add to the conversation, doodle 
      that stuff down in your journal instead.</p>
