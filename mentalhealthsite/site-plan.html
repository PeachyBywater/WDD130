      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>These days, information about topics such as mental health can be found all over the world wide web. 
        But how do you go through the tons of data that you can gather online? Which ones are reliable and trustworthy? 
        This website will be an online community where one can look for curated resources about mental health and other related issues. 
        Not to be mistaken as medical advice, only a social network where I can share what I have experienced and learned throughout 
        my mental health journey over the years.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is not intended to be a place for people to refer to in place of a proper medical assessment. 
        This is only a resource for those who are in the beginning stages of taking a closer look at their mental health. 
        The site can be considered a guide for many of us who are overwhelmed with the staggering amount of information 
        available on the world wide web. The target audience are mostly females, as young as teenagers to grandmothers. 
        They are tech-savvy, connected to people with social media, listen to podcasts and are open to new ideas about 
        the concept of mental health.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        [PURPOSE OF THIS WEBSITE
        The purpose of this website is to create a safe space for those who are starting their personal mental
        health journey. I want people who visit this site to feel that they can navigate through the material 
        without feeling the pressure or need to sign up for anything or immediately require their full commitment. 
        
        Making the decision to be aware of the status of your mental health can be very scary and intimidating. 
        This website will be some sort of wading pool that they can dip their toes in that can help them feel 
        that they do not need to be on this journey alone. They can start it with people who are in the same 
        situation as they are. This will be a place where a community can come together and help one another. 
        My hope is that this will be a source of valuable and credible information that has been curated based 
        mostly on what has worked for me, in my journey of mental wellness.  
        
        The first page will mostly be links to the other pages and social media links. Resources and phone numbers 
        for hotlines regarding mental health (suicide prevention, etc) will be present on there as well. I want the 
        first page to be clutter free as much as possible and give an impression of calm and serenity by using muted 
        colors and minimalist images. <!--Will also add a short introduction of myself, brief history of mental journey-->

      </ul>
      <h3>[WHAT TYPES OF RESOURCES CAN BE FOUND ON THE SITE]</h3>
      <p>
        [The second page will contain links to podcasts that I have personally listened to and have helped me in my 
        thought processes, in addition to therapy and medication. There will be a section where visitors can recommend 
        books that they have read and has helped them. They will have to be registered on the site to be able to do this, 
        for quality control purposes. I am also thinking about having a virtual whiteboard where people can anonymously 
        share what exercises or methods that has worked for them, or just to be able to leave hopeful messages and notes 
        to encourage others to keep going. I am not quite sure yet how to get this to work, but I will be closely monitoring 
        what messages have been sent in before they are posted, to make sure the page remains a safe space for everyone. 
        
        It will have a warning or disclaimer that although the sources of material have been researched and 
        proven credible to the best of my abilities, it is still not a replacement for proper diagnosis, treatment and 
        maintenance. There will also be community guidelines or rules that site visitors are expected to follow, to make sure
        that messages being posted in the whiteboard and book recommendations are appropriate.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        [The final page will be a way for the visitors to connect to one another if they so wish. They will need to sign up 
        and register for them to be able to participate in this. Members of the site can connect with people via forums. 
        These forums can range from people who use similar medications and how it has worked/not worked for them, groups for 
        people with similar diagnoses, people who are going through loss, etc. Each forum can choose a moderator who will keep 
        an eye on the things that people are posting. 

        While most of the elements available on site are like the many mental health websites, one thing that I think would 
        attract people to mine is that they can have access to the forums and all the information available without signing up 
        for anything. They only need to register if they would like to post book recommendations, write on the virtual white board, 
        and participate in the forums. This is mostly for content management, making sure that people who would like to share 
        information on the site are committed to helping others and not just for the fun of it.
