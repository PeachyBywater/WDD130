                <p><br>Hello and welcome to WAM!<br>
                
                   <br>My name is Peachy Bywater and I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about 5 years ago. This website
                   serves as an online journal of my mental wellness journey, and I'm so glad you're here!<br>
                
                   <br>When I received my formal diagnosis, I was devastated and relieved at the same time. My anxiety was manifesting
                   as anger, and it was affecting my relationships with my family and friends. I was glad to finally figure out what
                   was going on with me, but I was scared of how that might affect everything else in my life.<br>
                
                   <br>It took two years of therapy, being on medication and the constant support of my family and friends to be where 
                   I am at right now. And where I am at in my life is not perfect, but being aware of the status of my mental health 
                   has made a huge difference in my life. Here you can find information about my favorite podcasts that talk about 
                   mental health issues, book recommendations that has made a difference, and an opportunity to find people on the same
                   boat (or just want to help them paddle along) as you are.<br>
