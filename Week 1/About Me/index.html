    <p>I hope you are all doing well! So excited to be a part of this class. A few things
        about me: I was born and raised in the Philippines. My family moved to Singapore
        when I was in college. That is where I met my husband of almost 14 years (our dads
        served in the Filipino ward bishopric together!). My husband teaches HS Math and
        Science in international schools and we have previously lived in Singapore, Qatar,
        China and are currently based in Muscat, Oman. We have three wonderful daughters 
        and a dog.</p>
    
    <p>I love to read, mostly science fiction, fantasy and historical fiction. I'm into arts
        and crafts, gardening, trying new restaurants, travelling and taking naps. I have a 
        degree in communications and after years of hesitating about whether I should go back
        to school or not, here I am! I am hoping to finish my degree in Applied Technology. It 
        is way out of my comfort zone, but I discovered last semester that I love it!</p>

    <p>I am so grateful for this opportunity to be able to learn new skills. One of the reasons
        I went back to school was that I wanted to be a good example to my girls that learning 
        is an eternal pursuit. Looking forward to learning with and from all of you! I've added
        pictures of my family and our good boy, Fluffles. </p>
